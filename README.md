## Project Overview

This project is designed to be a simple yet effective emergency alert system. When a user presses a button, the system captures the current GPS location and sends an SMS with a Google Maps link to a predefined phone number. The system also activates a buzzer to confirm that the message was sent successfully. This makes it ideal for personal safety or emergency tracking applications.

## Features

- **GPS Tracking**: Accurately determines the user's location.
- **SMS Alerts**: Sends a text message with a Google Maps link.
- **Buzzer Notification**: Confirms message sending with an audible alert.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple button press to activate the system.
- **Lightweight and Compact**: Easy to carry and deploy.

## Getting Started

To set up the GPS Communication project, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano).
- A GPS module (e.g., Neo-6M).
- A GSM module (e.g., SIM800L).
- A buzzer.
- Jumper wires.
- A breadboard (optional).
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Federicour/-gps-communication.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**: 
   You will need to install the following libraries in your Arduino IDE:
   - TinyGPS++: For GPS data handling.
   - GSM library: For SMS functionality.

3. **Connect the Hardware**: 
   Connect the GPS and GSM modules to your Arduino board as follows:
   - GPS Module:
     - VCC to 5V
     - GND to GND
     - TX to Arduino RX
     - RX to Arduino TX
   - GSM Module:
     - VCC to 5V
     - GND to GND
     - TX to Arduino RX
     - RX to Arduino TX
   - Buzzer:
     - Positive terminal to a digital pin
     - Negative terminal to GND

4. **Upload the Code**: 
   Open the Arduino IDE, navigate to the cloned repository folder, and open the main `.ino` file. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

Once the hardware is set up and the code is uploaded, you can use the system as follows:

1. Press the designated button.
2. Wait for the buzzer to sound, indicating that the SMS has been sent.
3. Check the predefined phone number for the SMS containing the Google Maps link.

## How It Works

The system operates using the following steps:

1. **Button Press**: When the button is pressed, the Arduino triggers the GPS module to get the current location.
2. **GPS Data Retrieval**: The GPS module sends the latitude and longitude to the Arduino.
3. **SMS Sending**: The Arduino uses the GSM module to send an SMS to the predefined phone number, including a Google Maps link.
4. **Buzzer Activation**: After sending the SMS, the buzzer sounds to confirm that the alert has been sent.
